# Risk Policy Scoring form

A shiny app survey produced for the purposes of completing the risk policy scoring by the PDT. Factor scores from the PDT will be combined with the [New England Fishery Management Council's (NEFMC) weightings](https://github.com/AngeliaMiller/nefmc-risk-weighting) to apply the Council's Risk Policy in their decision making. 

The app was developed using the [surveydown R package](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/surveydown).
